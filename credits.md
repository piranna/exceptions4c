# Credits #

I would like to thank **José Antonio Gimeno** for his continued support and advice, and **Miguel Frutos** for his suggestions on the Dispose Pattern.

Also, thanks to **dreamlax** for testing the library on several platforms.

The design of the "sheep logo" <img src='http://exceptions4c.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/etc/img/logo/sheep_016.png' alt='exceptions4c' width='16' height='16' /> was based on an original idea of **Iris Zaldívar**.
